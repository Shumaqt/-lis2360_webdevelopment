<h1>How to Make a Song</h1>
<h2><em>Overview</em></h2>

<p>Music is everywhere. It is a language of its own that has been around since the beginning of time. It is an abstract concept that gives everyone the ability to create or simply listen. Artists can construct a song from scratch into a beautiful, meaningful work of art for the world to appreciate. With hundreds of different genres to choose from, there is music available to anyone which can be enjoyed on the way to work, during a workout, or even in the comfort of their own home. </p>


<p>The creation of a song is essentially a pretty complex concept. A lot more work and time goes into its preparation than many people would assume. Regardless of the possible difficulties, songwriting can be very rewarding. Once a song is finalized for streaming, that artist will soon be recognized for their artwork. One can never predict the potential positive life-changing things that can occur from their music.   </p>


<p>Songwriting is far more than jotting down lyrics on a piece of paper. The lyrics must mean something. The message of the song is relayed through the emotion of the artist that can be felt by the pitch of their voice, the tempo, and the various instruments that synchronize seamlessly. Anyone can write a song. It takes a true artist to be able to make the audience feel something. It is a skill that requires plenty of patience, practice, and self-discovery. </p>

<p>At first the process can be a daunting task. An artist does not go platinum on his/her first single, usually. The point is not to help someone become an award-winning artist, but to give individuals an outlet to illustrate themselves in a creative way. Whether you want to create music for expressing yourself or to help others, learning the basics is a fun process that anyone can learn. </p>

  <p><em><strong>The key to songwriting is just to be able to observe, and put yourself in situations to be around people, and let those ideas come to you.  ~Eric Church</strong></em></p>
